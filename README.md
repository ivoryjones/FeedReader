Project 6 - Ivory Jones

To access the project open index.html in a web browser. 

It uses Jasmine v2.1.2 documentation for testing.

For this project, I wrote test suites and specs to test various funtions in the RSS Feed. 

To complete this project I completed the JavaScript testing course. I also used the Jasmine 2.1.2 documentation and stackoverflow as resources. 

Formatted code to be consistent with the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide

Added specific comments to each test and removed the TODO comments.
